# Fortran Week One Solution

This repository contains the code solution for the first week of Fortran lessons in [AOS 573](http://aos573.github.io). See the assignment [here](https://aos573.github.io/assignments/2-fortran-intro.html).

Note a compilation script is added strictly for ease--it was not required.
